This week I mainly focused on creating the map and learning leaflet and openstreetmap usage. Now the code can be run and it opens an html file (works at least on chrome and firefox) that open on the browser showcasing a map of finland. User can add markers by clicking on the map (writing in city names to add a marker doesn't work yet) and the map shows a pop up od the list of markers, the point of this is to help debugging and next week those markers will be turned into nodes for the algoritms to work on. 
Testing hasn't improved because there isn't much to test as I focused on javascript and html files this week rather than actual java code that will be tested. Javadoc has been done.
