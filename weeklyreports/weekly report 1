This week I spent most of my time reading the course material, choosing the topic and familiarizing myself with the algorithms I will be using.
The project has been started, the topic is chosen and algorithms as well but no code has been written yet.
This week I mainly learnt about the different uses of algortihms but the tim complexities and space usage was something I am still unsure of and will need to read more on those next week.
Next week I will focus on the visualization of the map and getting familiar with the necessary APIs and putting nodes on the map based on given input.
